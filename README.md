# IHC-HPA-Image-Analysis
## Python Vector Approach.py
This repository contains a Python-based tool for quantifying protein expression in tissue images, focusing on DAB (brown) and Hematoxylin (blue) staining. The tool employs a vector-based approach for image processing, offering an alternative to traditional methods like ImageJ's colour deconvolution. 

## Fiji Colour Deconvolute(2) & Image Calculator Stain Separation.ijm
In addition to the Python-based tool, we compared it to an ImageJ method to quantify protein expression in tissue images. The ImageJ workflow combines colour deconvolution and image calculator techniques to separate and quantify the DAB (brown) stain. 

## Assessing Fiji Image Outputs.py
Finally, this Python script assesses the outputs of the Fiji method in the same way as the initial Python vector approach.
